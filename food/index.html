      <p>Cwie mie is a Chinese descent culinary that is widespread around the city of Malang. Currently, the name cwie mie has started to change its name to noodle dumplings.

        The reason for changing naam cwie noodles to noodle dumplings is because dumplings are always there to accompany the noodles.</p>

       <p>
        In Malang there are quite a lot of noodle dumpling depots that are established, such as Depot Sawahan, Depot Lima Satu, Gang Jangkring Depot, Bromo Pojok Mie Dumpling, Gajah Mada Depot, and Dempo Mie Pangsit.
       
        Most of the depots serve homemade noodles using traditional to modern methods. The size of the noodles for poor cwie tends to be small. Cwie noodles served with chicken that has been smashed, gravy, and a sprinkling of green onions.
       
        The appearance of this typical Malang food is very simple, but the taste can be addictive. Usually cwie noodles are eaten with a side menu that is sold separately, such as dumplings, stuffed tofu, and fried shrimp meatballs.</p>
